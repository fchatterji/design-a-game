##Game Description:

Hangman is a simple word guessing game. At the start of the game, the computer randomly selects a word (from a very small sample subset).

Each turn, the user has to guess a letter. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed. If not, the user has to guess again.

If the user hasn't guessed the word in a fixed ampount of attempts(9 by default), he loses the game.

Many different Hangman games can be played by many different Users at any given time. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter `urlsafe_game_key`.

After each game, a score is calculated as follows:
- 10 points for winning the game
- 5 additionnal points per attempts remaining at the end of the game
- 0 points if the player loses

It is possible to access user rankings, previous games and high scores.


##How to play the game

- Use create_game to create a game. Remember to copy the urlsafe_key property for later use.
- Use the make_move endpoint to male moves.
- Use cancel_game to cancel a game in progress. 
- Use get_game, along with the urlsafe_key, to continue an ongoing game.
